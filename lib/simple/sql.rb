    # Rails handles ActiveRecord connections (it checks it out of a connection pool when
    # needed for the first time in a request cycle, and checks it in afterwards) we need
    # to make sure not to keep a reference to the actual connection object around. Instead
    # we need to be able to call a function (in that case ActiveRecord::Base.connection).

    # In non-Rails mode the connector really is a lambda which just returns an object.
    #
    # In any case the connector is stored in a thread-safe fashion. This is not necessary
    # in Rails mode (because AR::B.connection itself is thread-safe already), but in non-
    # Rails-mode we make sure to manage one connection per thread.
